Hawkins Readiness Network is an offline-first disaster preparedness prototype inspired by Stranger Things. It helps communities prepare, practice, and respond to emergencies through interactive test drills, location-based risk awareness, shelter mapping, and community feedback.

PROBLEM STATEMENT

The current state of disaster preparedness is nothing but a piece of paper, in the form of guidelines, PDFs, or posters that people quickly scan and then forget. When a disaster actually strikes, people panic not because they do not have information, but because they have never actually practiced what to do, where to go, or whom to call.

Critical information such as safe zones, emergency shelters, evacuation routes, and response teams is either missing, outdated, or not accessible during a disaster. This causes confusion and inaction, and people are left to act impulsively rather than act together and effectively. 

PROPOSED IDEA OF THE SOLUTION

The proposed solution for the problem is a Disaster Preparedness Web Application that aims to convert passive awareness into active preparedness. The application not only presents information but also engages users, trains them, and tests them on real-life disaster situations.

The application offers the following:
- Disaster-related information for earthquakes, floods, and cyclones
- Safety instructions and procedures to be followed
- Drill options for interactive simulation of real-life emergency situations
- Quizzes with multiple-choice options to test the preparedness of users
- Feedback and scoring to enable users to know their weaknesses in preparedness
