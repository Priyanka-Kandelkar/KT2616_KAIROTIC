Hawkins Readiness Network is an offline-first disaster preparedness prototype inspired by Stranger Things. It helps communities prepare, practice, and respond to emergencies through interactive test drills, location-based risk awareness, shelter mapping, and community feedback.

Problem Statement:
The current disaster preparedness only boils down to guidelines, PDFs, or posters that people quickly skim and forget. Moreover, when a disaster occurs, people get scared not because of a lack of information but because they have never rehearsed what to do, where to go, and whom to contact. It results in confusion and inaction because such key information as safe zones, emergency shelters, evacuation routes, and response teams is generally missing, old, or difficult to get during a disaster. Therefore, people simply react without thinking and hardly collaborate with each other.

Proposed Idea of the Solution:                                               
The proposed solution is a Disaster Preparedness Web Application that intends to change the unproductive awareness into productive preparedness.This application is not just a source of information, but also a medium that engages users, educates them, and evaluates them on the scenarios of disaster situations.

The application provides:
• Information about disasters like earthquakes, floods, and cyclones.
• Safety instructions and measures to be taken.
• Guided drills for an interactive simulation of a real, life emergency situation.
• Quizzes with multiple, choice questions to test preparedness.
• Feedback and scoring to guide users towards the areas of preparedness that need improvement
